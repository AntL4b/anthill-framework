- Add some middlewares (a good source of candidate can be found here: https://github.com/middyjs/middy/tree/main/packages)
- Think about putting http cache system inside a middleware (maybe not that good)
- Implement a DTO (request / response) for callables
- System for registering handlers with more ease
- AHLambdaHandler ? for lambdas that are not trigged by api gateway
